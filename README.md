The Python plugin makes the app extendable by Python modules.
The built-in albert module exposes several functions and classes for use with Albert.
See the [Python stub file](https://github.com/albertlauncher/python/blob/master/albert.pyi) for a detailed interface specification.
The Python plugins are loaded from `<APPDATADIR>/python/plugins`.
